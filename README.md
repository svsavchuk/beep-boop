# Beep Boop
_Created 6/14/2019._
#### By Serhiy Savchuk
_This web application takes a number from a user and returns a range of numbers from 0 to the user-inputted number with the following exceptions:_
* _Numbers that contain 1: all digits are replaced with "Beep!"_
* _Numbers that contain 2: all digits are replaced with "Boop!"_
* _Numbers that contain 3: all digits are replaced with "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."_

_These exceptions are written from least to most important. The first exception applies unless the second exception does, and the same with the second and third. So, for example:_
* _The number 13 will be replaced with "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."_
* _The number 21 will be replaced with "Boop"._
* _The number 32 will be replaced with "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."_

_A user will be able to enter a new number and see new results over and over again._
